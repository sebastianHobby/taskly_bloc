> Core promise and messaging live in: [PRODUCT_CONCEPT.md](PRODUCT_CONCEPT.md)

## My Day

**Primary purpose**: My Day is today's plan - a calm, values-aligned focus list
that still respects deadlines. It is the execution view for today.

**Description line (UI copy)**
- "Your plan for today - what matters and what's due."

**Key question it answers**
- "What matters and what's due?"

**What it shows**
- My Day shows the tasks and routines you've chosen for today.

## Anytime (Project Planning)

**Primary purpose**: Anytime is the place you record everything you plan to
work on - a project-first view of tasks that My Day draws from.

**Description line (UI copy)**
- "Project-first planning for tasks you'll work on (and the source for My Day)."

**Key question it answers**
- "What's in my projects right now?"

**What it shows**
- Anytime shows project groups first, with their tasks beneath - everything you
  intend to work on.

## Scheduled (Date Lens)

**Primary purpose**: Scheduled is your timeline lens - a date-based view of
tasks and projects for planning ahead.

**Description line (UI copy)**
- "A date-based view of tasks and projects to help you plan ahead."

**Key question it answers**
- "What's coming up and when?"

**What it shows**
- Scheduled shows what's due and what's upcoming, organized by day.
