## My Day

**Primary purpose**: My Day is everything you need to do today from the plan
you selected.

**Description line (UI copy)**
- "Everything to do today from your selected plan."

**Key question it answers**
- "What do I need to do today?"

**What it shows**
- My Day shows the tasks and routines you selected for today, so you can work
  through the day with less context switching.

## Projects (Future Backlog)

**Primary purpose**: Projects is where you keep your future work backlog.

**Description line (UI copy)**
- "Your backlog of future tasks and projects."

**Key question it answers**
- "What should I put on deck for future days?"

**What it shows**
- Projects shows grouped project work and planned tasks so users can capture,
  organize, and keep a clear pipeline of what to do next.

## Scheduled (Date Lens)

**Primary purpose**: Scheduled is your timeline lens - a date-based view of
tasks and projects for planning ahead.

**Description line (UI copy)**
- "A calendar lens for what is due and what is coming next."

**Key question it answers**
- "What's coming up and when?"

**What it shows**
