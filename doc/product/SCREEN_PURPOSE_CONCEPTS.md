## My Day

**Primary purpose**: My Day is today's plan - a calm, values-aligned focus list
that still respects deadlines. It is the execution view for today.

**Description line (UI copy)**
- "Your plan for today - values and due dates."

**Key question it answers**
- "What should I focus on today?"

**What it shows**
- My Day shows the tasks and routines you've chosen for today.

## Projects (Planning Source)

**Primary purpose**: Projects is where you build your project list - the
source for today's plan in My Day.

**Description line (UI copy)**
- "Source for today's plan."

**Key question it answers**
- "What should My Day pull from?"

**What it shows**
- Projects shows project groups first, with their tasks beneath - everything you
  intend to work on.

## Scheduled (Date Lens)

**Primary purpose**: Scheduled is your timeline lens - a date-based view of
tasks and projects for planning ahead.

**Description line (UI copy)**
- "A date-based view of tasks and projects to help you plan ahead."

**Key question it answers**
- "What's coming up and when?"
