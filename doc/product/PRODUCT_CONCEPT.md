## Core promise

"Taskly captures everything you need to do, ties it to your values, and
surfaces the right task at the right time -- so you hit deadlines while keeping
what matters in focus."

## Support line

"Capture everything once, then Taskly brings forward what matters and what's
due -- keeping you focused and grounded."

## Benefits (3)

1) Everything captured, nothing forgotten.
2) Balance deadlines with values-aligned priorities.
3) A calmer rhythm for real life, even on busy weeks.
