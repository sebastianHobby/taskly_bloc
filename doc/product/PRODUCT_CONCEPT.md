## Core promise

"Taskly captures everything you need to do, ties it to your values, and turns
your projects into today's plan -- so you hit deadlines while keeping your
values in focus."

## Support line

"Capture everything once, then Taskly brings forward your values and due dates
-- with Projects as the source for My Day."
