## Summary

This plan implements the accepted attention UI decisions:
- Global bell entrypoint (bell → inbox)
- Summary strip placement on My Day / Anytime / Scheduled with hide-when-zero
- Calm My Day hero integration

And includes an agreed inbox redesign direction (no tabs, entity-first) as a
later phase.
