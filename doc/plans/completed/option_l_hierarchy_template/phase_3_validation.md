## Objective
Validate correctness and guard against regressions.

Deliverables:
- Update/add unit tests for strict params decode + encode round-trips.
- Run the recorded test runner once and capture artifacts.

## AI instructions
- Review `doc/architecture/` before implementing.
- Run `flutter analyze` for this phase.
- Fix any errors or warnings introduced by the phase.
- If architecture changes are introduced, update the relevant `doc/architecture/` docs in the same PR.
