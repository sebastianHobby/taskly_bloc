# UI Decisions Log

This folder captures UI/UX design decisions as lightweight, reviewable records.

## When to write a log entry

Write a log entry when:
- UI/UX changes are being proposed but not yet approved for implementation.
- There are multiple viable UI/UX options and we want a durable record of the
  trade-offs and the chosen direction.

This is intentionally **not** a full implementation plan.

## File naming

Use: `YYYY-MM-DD_<short_title>.md`

Example: `2026-01-15_task_row_density.md`

## Suggested template

Start from the template: `_TEMPLATE.md`.
