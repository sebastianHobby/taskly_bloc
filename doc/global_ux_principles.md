# Global UX Principles

## Purpose
Taskly balances meaning and urgency. Values guide direction; deadlines add
constraints. The system must feel trustworthy and calm across all screens.

## Core Principles
- **Values-first guidance**: Values set direction; urgency nudges, not overrides.
- **Trusted execution**: My Day is the focused action lens.
- **Calm planning**: Anytime and Scheduled are stable planning views.
- **Consistency**: Task and project rows share the same visual grammar.
- **Clarity over noise**: Use subtle emphasis, avoid alarm-heavy visuals.

## Screen Intent
- **My Day**: Execution surface. Focus mode is allowed here only.
- **Anytime**: Values-led planning and backlog view.
- **Scheduled**: Deadline-led commitments view.

## Visual Hierarchy
- **Values**
  - Primary: section headers (value group headers)
  - Secondary: value chips in the meta line
- **Urgency**
  - Date chips + subtle row accent only
  - No heavy badges unless critical

## Ordering Rules (Perceived)
- **My Day**: blended ordering (value + urgency)
- **Anytime**: value-first ordering
- **Scheduled**: deadline-first ordering

## Row Consistency
- Shared padding, title style, and meta line layout across task/project rows.
- Trailing actions align in placement and visual weight.
- Project progress is de-emphasized in Anytime to keep the list calm.
