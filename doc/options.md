Option A — Sprint (Task‑First, No Guard Rails)

Mechanic: Score all tasks globally → take top N (e.g., 10).
Values: Tasks use explicit values; if missing, inherit project values.
Priorities: Task priority influences score; project priority mostly ignored.
Neglect: Off (or minimal).
Diversity: None; one project can take 9/10.
Best for: Deadline weeks, single-project sprints.
Tradeoff: Can undermine balance/wellbeing and starve slow-burn values/projects.
Option B — Balanced (Task‑First + Soft Guard Rails)

Mechanic: Still global task selection, but dynamic scoring nudges variety and prevents starvation.
Values: Inheritance + optional task override.
Priorities:
⭐ task priority = small additive boost
🏷️ project priority = (1) small multiplier on tasks AND (2) reduces diversity “tax” so high-priority projects can contribute more.
Neglect:
⚖️ value neglect = boosts under-served values
🏗️ project neglect = boosts stalled projects
Diversity: 🌈 diminishing returns penalty per extra task from same project (soft, not a ban).
Best for: Default mode for “value-aligned + right time + wellbeing.”
Tradeoff: Slightly harder to explain; needs tuning to avoid feeling “over-managed.”
Option C — Balanced (Task‑First + Hard Cap Guard Rails)

Mechanic: Score tasks globally → take top N subject to cap (e.g., max 5 tasks per project).
Values: Inheritance + optional override.
Priorities: Same as Balanced; project priority can optionally relax the cap or slow the penalty (if you combine with soft).
Neglect: Optional (often still useful).
Diversity: Guaranteed by constraint (cap).
Best for: Users who want predictably mixed days.
Tradeoff: Can feel rigid in “one-big-project” seasons; might force lower-merit tasks in.
Option D — Portfolio (Project‑First)

Mechanic: Score/select focus projects by value/priority/neglect → pick top X tasks per project.
Values: Primarily project-driven; tasks inherit unless overridden.
Priorities: Project priority is first-class; task priority only within project.
Neglect: Naturally expressible at both value and project level.
Diversity: Built-in (by selecting multiple projects).
Best for: Users who want explicit whole-life planning and steady multi-project progress.
Tradeoff: More setup/metadata dependence; can feel restrictive; must handle “project has no next action” well.
Cross-cutting rule (applies to all)

Project Health as attention rules (no next action, blocked, no progress, high-value neglect):
Not part of allocation math directly; it surfaces as alerts/items and can optionally feed small boosts in Balanced modes.
If you want a single recommendation: ship Balanced (soft guard rails) as default, offer Sprint and Portfolio as selectable planning styles, and keep Hard Cap as an “advanced” toggle under Balanced for users who want stronger variety guarantees.
