# Feature Specs (Authoritative)

Each feature has one authoritative spec. These docs define current behavior and implementation contracts.

## Specs

- `doc/features/tasks/SPEC.md`
- `doc/features/routines/SPEC.md`
- `doc/features/checklists/SPEC.md`
- `doc/features/my_day_plan_my_day/SPEC.md`
- `doc/features/scheduled/SPEC.md`
- `doc/features/projects/SPEC.md`
- `doc/features/values_and_recommendations/SPEC.md`
- `doc/features/attention_review_journal_stats/SPEC.md`
- `doc/features/settings_preferences/SPEC.md`
- `doc/features/auth_onboarding_session/SPEC.md`
- `doc/features/notifications/SPEC.md`

## Authoring rules

- One spec per feature.
- No changelog-style working specs in active folders.
- Superseded docs go to `doc/archive/`.
- Feature specs may reference architecture invariants but must not redefine them.
