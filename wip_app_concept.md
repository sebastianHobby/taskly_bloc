# Taskly: Values-Aligned Task Management

Taskly is a comprehensive productivity app designed to help you prioritize and plan based on your personal values and wellbeing. Rather than just tracking what you need to do, Taskly helps you understand *why* you're doing it and ensures your daily actions align with what matters most to you.

## 1. Define WHAT You Want to Do

**Tasks & Projects with Rich Metadata:**
- Create tasks with names, descriptions, start dates, priority levels (P1-P4) and deadlines
- Organize related tasks into **projects** (which can also have their own deadlines and priorities)
- Define **start dates** - tasks can't be worked on until they're actually actionable
- Add **recurring tasks** using flexible scheduling patterns
- Attach multiple **labels** for categorization with custom colors and icons
- Link tasks and projects to your personal **values** to maintain alignment

**Flexible Organization:**
- **Inbox** for tasks without a project
- Browse all **Projects** and **Labels** in dedicated views
- Project detail pages show all tasks linked to project in context

## 2. Define WHY You Do What You Do

**Values - Your North Star:**
- Create custom **value tags** representing what matters to you (e.g., Family, Learning, Career, Health)
- Values are prominently featured throughout the app with custom colors and icons
- Link every task and project to one or more values
- View dedicated **Values** screen with stats showing completion rates and task distribution.
- Values are ranked by priority - clearly shown on values screen and easily changed by user.

## 3. Discover What to Work On Next

**My Day - Your Personalized Focus View:**

Choose how you want to prioritize your tasks by selecting a **persona** that matches your working style:

- **The Idealist**: Focus purely on value alignment without urgency pressure - perfect when you want to stay true to your long-term goals
- **The Reflector**: Brings balance by prioritizing values you've been neglecting - helps ensure all important areas of your life get attention
- **The Realist** *(recommended)*: Balances value alignment with approaching deadlines - get notified about urgent tasks while staying values-focused
- **The Firefighter**: Urgency-first mode that includes all pressing tasks regardless of value alignment - for when you need to handle critical deadlines
- **Custom**: Fine-tune every setting to create your own personalized approach

**Take Control of Your Focus:**
- **Pin important tasks** to ensure they always appear on your My Day list, regardless of the persona you choose
- Set your **daily task limit** to prevent overwhelm and maintain sustainable productivity
- **See exactly why** each task made the cut with allocation transparency - understand which value qualified each task and why others were excluded
- **Fine-tune your settings** to adjust urgency thresholds, neglect timeframes, and other parameters to match your unique needs
- Get **alerts for excluded urgent tasks** so nothing critical falls through the cracks (configurable based on persona)

Your My Day view adapts to how *you* work, helping you maintain focus on what matters while staying aware of time-sensitive commitments.

## 4. Track HOW It Impacts Your Wellbeing

**Rich Journaling & Mood Tracking:**
- Create **journal entries** with timestamps
- Record your **mood** using a 5-level scale (Very Low 😢, Low 😕, Neutral 😐, Good 🙂, Excellent 😄)
- Add **journal text** for detailed reflections
- Create **custom trackers** with multiple response types:
  - **Choice**: Select from multiple options
  - **Scale**: Rate on a numeric range
  - **Yes/No**: Simple binary tracking
- Configure trackers as **daily** (once per day) or **per-entry** (multiple times per day)

** Journal pages provide easy way to view all journal entries in a date/timeline like view. Follows best practice UX/UI - similar to daylio.

## 5. Workflow Reviews - Your Productivity Safety Net:

Never worry about tasks falling through the cracks or losing track of what matters.

You Control:

What gets reviewed (tasks, projects, values, labels)
When reviews trigger:
Time intervals (weekly, monthly, custom)
Stale items (no activity for X days)
Wellbeing changes (mood drops X%)
Approaching deadlines (urgent within X days)
Value neglect (a value hasn't been worked on for X days)
Value imbalance (actual time spent differs from your priorities by X%)
You Benefit:

Trust your system - know nothing's being forgotten
Catch problems early - before they become urgent
Improve your process - spot patterns and eliminate friction
Stay aligned - regular check-ins keep you on track with your values
Maintain balance - get notified when you're neglecting important life areas
Verify alignment - confirm your daily actions reflect what you say matters most
Prevent burnout - catch early signs of overcommitting to one area at the expense of others
Reviews act like a mirror for your productivity system, helping you see when you're drifting off-course and giving you the opportunity to course-correct before small misalignments become major life imbalances.
